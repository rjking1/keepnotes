# keepnotes

Two python files to process keep notes dumped from Google Takeaway into a csv file that can be uploaded into WordPress

* keep.py processes the html files (from https://github.com/jcontini/google-keep-csv)
* keepj.py processes the json files (the json enables us to get at the annotations which are not in the html)
